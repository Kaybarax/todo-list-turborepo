# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Revise the `packages/ui-web` design system to be built strictly on top of DaisyUI as the foundational UI kit, while integrating Style Dictionary for comprehensive design token management and generation. This revision will ensure that all components strictly comply with DaisyUI's design system principles, leverage DaisyUI's theming capabilities, and use Style Dictionary to manage and generate design tokens across multiple platforms and formats.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on React web applications in this project, I want the ui-web design system to be built strictly on top of DaisyUI, so that I can leverage DaisyUI's comprehensive component library and theming system while maintaining consistency across all web applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I examine ui-web components THEN they SHALL be built using DaisyUI component classes as the foundation
2. WHEN I use ui-web components THEN they SHALL inherit all DaisyUI theming capabilities and theme switching
3. WHEN I need component variants THEN they SHALL map directly to DaisyUI's built-in variants and modifiers
4. WHEN I apply custom styling THEN it SHALL extend DaisyUI classes rather than replace them
5. IF DaisyUI provides a component THEN the ui-web design system SHALL use it as the base implementation
6. WHEN I switch DaisyUI themes THEN all ui-web components SHALL automatically adapt their appearance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Style Dictionary integrated into the ui-web design system, so that design tokens can be managed centrally and generated in multiple formats for consistent use across different platforms and build processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I define design tokens THEN Style Dictionary SHALL generate CSS custom properties, JavaScript/TypeScript exports, and Tailwind configuration
2. WHEN I need design tokens THEN they SHALL be available as CSS variables, JS/TS constants, and Tailwind utility classes
3. WHEN I update a design token THEN Style Dictionary SHALL regenerate all output formats automatically
4. WHEN I build the design system THEN Style Dictionary SHALL run as part of the build process
5. IF I need platform-specific tokens THEN Style Dictionary SHALL generate appropriate formats for web, mobile, and other platforms
6. WHEN I use design tokens THEN they SHALL have proper TypeScript types and IntelliSense support

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the design token system to align with DaisyUI's theming structure, so that tokens work seamlessly with DaisyUI's built-in theme switching and customization capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I define color tokens THEN they SHALL map to DaisyUI's semantic color system (primary, secondary, accent, neutral, etc.)
2. WHEN I create custom themes THEN they SHALL be compatible with DaisyUI's theme structure and CSS custom properties
3. WHEN I use spacing tokens THEN they SHALL align with DaisyUI's spacing scale and Tailwind's spacing system
4. WHEN I define typography tokens THEN they SHALL work with DaisyUI's typography utilities and components
5. IF I need custom design tokens THEN they SHALL extend DaisyUI's token system without conflicting with it
6. WHEN themes are switched THEN both DaisyUI and custom tokens SHALL update consistently

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all ui-web components to strictly follow DaisyUI's component patterns and accessibility standards, so that I get consistent behavior, styling, and accessibility compliance across all components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use form components THEN they SHALL use DaisyUI's form component classes and structure
2. WHEN I interact with components THEN they SHALL follow DaisyUI's interaction patterns and states
3. WHEN I need component sizes THEN they SHALL use DaisyUI's size modifiers (btn-xs, btn-sm, btn-lg, etc.)
4. WHEN I check accessibility THEN components SHALL inherit DaisyUI's built-in accessibility features
5. IF a component needs custom functionality THEN it SHALL extend DaisyUI components rather than replace them
6. WHEN I use component variants THEN they SHALL correspond to DaisyUI's variant system

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build system to integrate Style Dictionary token generation with DaisyUI configuration, so that the design system builds efficiently and tokens are properly synchronized with DaisyUI themes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the build process THEN Style Dictionary SHALL generate tokens before Tailwind CSS compilation
2. WHEN tokens are generated THEN they SHALL be automatically injected into the DaisyUI theme configuration
3. WHEN I develop locally THEN Style Dictionary SHALL watch for token changes and regenerate outputs
4. WHEN I build for production THEN the process SHALL optimize and minify generated token files
5. IF token generation fails THEN the build process SHALL provide clear error messages and fail gracefully
6. WHEN I update DaisyUI themes THEN Style Dictionary SHALL reflect those changes in generated tokens

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive TypeScript support for both DaisyUI components and Style Dictionary tokens, so that I get full type safety and IntelliSense when using the design system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I import ui-web components THEN I SHALL get TypeScript types that include DaisyUI variant options
2. WHEN I use design tokens THEN they SHALL have proper TypeScript interfaces and type definitions
3. WHEN I access theme values THEN TypeScript SHALL provide autocomplete for available token names
4. WHEN I misuse component props THEN TypeScript SHALL show errors for invalid DaisyUI variants
5. IF I extend components THEN TypeScript SHALL validate that extensions are compatible with DaisyUI patterns
6. WHEN I build the project THEN TypeScript SHALL validate all token references and component usage

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the apps/web application updated to use the revised DaisyUI-based design system with Style Dictionary tokens, so that the web application demonstrates proper usage and benefits from the improved design system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I examine apps/web components THEN they SHALL use the revised ui-web components with DaisyUI foundation
2. WHEN I look at styling in apps/web THEN it SHALL use Style Dictionary generated tokens instead of hardcoded values
3. WHEN I switch themes in apps/web THEN the application SHALL use DaisyUI's theme switching mechanism
4. WHEN I build apps/web THEN it SHALL consume the generated design tokens and DaisyUI configuration
5. IF apps/web needs custom styling THEN it SHALL use the design system's token-based approach
6. WHEN I run apps/web THEN it SHALL demonstrate all DaisyUI themes and design system capabilities

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper documentation and examples for the DaisyUI + Style Dictionary integration, so that I can understand how to use the design system effectively and contribute to its development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I read the documentation THEN it SHALL explain how DaisyUI and Style Dictionary work together
2. WHEN I need examples THEN the documentation SHALL provide code samples for common use cases
3. WHEN I want to add new tokens THEN the documentation SHALL explain the Style Dictionary configuration process
4. WHEN I need to customize DaisyUI themes THEN the documentation SHALL provide clear guidelines
5. IF I want to contribute THEN the documentation SHALL explain the development workflow and standards
6. WHEN I troubleshoot issues THEN the documentation SHALL provide debugging guides for common problems
