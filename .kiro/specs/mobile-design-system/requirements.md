# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the existing `packages/ui-mobile` into a comprehensive design system that serves as the single source of truth for all UI components, design tokens, typography, spacing, and visual elements used in `apps/mobile`. The design system will establish consistency, maintainability, and scalability for the mobile application while providing a complete component library with Storybook documentation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile developer, I want a comprehensive design system with design tokens, so that I can maintain visual consistency across the entire mobile application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to use colors THEN the design system SHALL provide a complete color palette with semantic naming
2. WHEN I need typography THEN the design system SHALL provide standardized font families, sizes, weights, and line heights
3. WHEN I need spacing THEN the design system SHALL provide a consistent spacing scale for margins, padding, and gaps
4. WHEN I need border radii THEN the design system SHALL provide standardized border radius values
5. WHEN I need shadows THEN the design system SHALL provide elevation system with consistent shadow definitions
6. IF I need breakpoints THEN the design system SHALL provide responsive breakpoint definitions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile developer, I want a complete component library, so that I can build UI screens without creating custom components from scratch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need basic components THEN the design system SHALL provide Button, Text, Input, Card, and Container components
2. WHEN I need navigation components THEN the design system SHALL provide TabBar, Header, and NavigationButton components
3. WHEN I need form components THEN the design system SHALL provide Form, FormField, Checkbox, Switch, and Picker components
4. WHEN I need feedback components THEN the design system SHALL provide Alert, Toast, Loading, and Modal components
5. WHEN I need list components THEN the design system SHALL provide List, ListItem, and ScrollView components
6. WHEN I need layout components THEN the design system SHALL provide Stack, Grid, and Spacer components
7. WHEN I use any component THEN it SHALL be fully typed with TypeScript interfaces
8. WHEN I use any component THEN it SHALL support theme customization through props

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mobile developer, I want comprehensive Storybook documentation, so that I can understand how to use each component and see all available variants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access Storybook THEN I SHALL see all components organized by category
2. WHEN I view a component story THEN I SHALL see all available props and their types
3. WHEN I view a component story THEN I SHALL see multiple usage examples and variants
4. WHEN I view a component story THEN I SHALL see interactive controls to modify props
5. WHEN I view design tokens THEN I SHALL see visual representations of colors, typography, and spacing
6. WHEN I view the design system THEN I SHALL see usage guidelines and best practices

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mobile developer, I want the mobile app to use only design system components, so that the UI is consistent and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I examine apps/mobile code THEN it SHALL import all UI components from @todo/ui-mobile
2. WHEN I examine apps/mobile code THEN it SHALL use design tokens for all styling values
3. WHEN I examine apps/mobile code THEN it SHALL NOT contain custom StyleSheet definitions for basic UI elements
4. WHEN I examine apps/mobile code THEN it SHALL NOT contain hardcoded color, spacing, or typography values
5. WHEN the mobile app renders THEN all components SHALL have consistent visual appearance
6. WHEN the mobile app renders THEN all interactive elements SHALL have consistent behavior

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mobile developer, I want theme support in the design system, so that I can implement dark mode and other theme variations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure themes THEN the design system SHALL support light and dark theme variants
2. WHEN I switch themes THEN all components SHALL automatically adapt their colors and styles
3. WHEN I create custom themes THEN the design system SHALL provide a theme configuration interface
4. WHEN I use themed components THEN they SHALL maintain accessibility contrast ratios
5. WHEN themes change THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and performant

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a mobile developer, I want accessibility-compliant components, so that the mobile app is usable by all users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use interactive components THEN they SHALL have proper accessibility labels and hints
2. WHEN I use components THEN they SHALL support screen reader navigation
3. WHEN I use components THEN they SHALL have appropriate touch target sizes (minimum 44px)
4. WHEN I use color-based information THEN components SHALL provide alternative indicators
5. WHEN I use form components THEN they SHALL have proper focus management and validation feedback
6. WHEN components have state changes THEN they SHALL announce changes to assistive technologies

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a mobile developer, I want comprehensive testing for all design system components, so that I can trust their reliability and behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run tests THEN each component SHALL have unit tests covering all props and states
2. WHEN I run tests THEN each component SHALL have accessibility tests
3. WHEN I run tests THEN theme switching SHALL be tested for all components
4. WHEN I run tests THEN component interactions SHALL be tested (press, focus, etc.)
5. WHEN I run tests THEN the test coverage SHALL be at least 90% for all components
6. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL complete successfully in CI/CD pipeline

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a mobile developer, I want proper TypeScript support throughout the design system, so that I get compile-time safety and excellent developer experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I import components THEN they SHALL have complete TypeScript definitions
2. WHEN I use component props THEN TypeScript SHALL provide autocomplete and validation
3. WHEN I use design tokens THEN they SHALL be strongly typed with literal types
4. WHEN I create theme configurations THEN they SHALL be type-safe
5. WHEN I build the project THEN there SHALL be no TypeScript errors in the design system
6. WHEN I use the design system THEN IDE SHALL provide helpful IntelliSense support
