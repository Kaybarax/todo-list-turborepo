# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves revising the existing mobile UI design system in `packages/ui-mobile` to be built on top of Eva Design from UI Kitten, which will become the default UI kit for all Expo React Native mobile apps in this project. The revision will also integrate Style Dictionary for design token management and generation, ensuring a scalable and maintainable design system that follows Eva Design principles while maintaining the existing component API surface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Eva Design System Integration

**User Story:** As a mobile developer, I want the UI components to be built on Eva Design from UI Kitten, so that I have access to a comprehensive, well-tested design system with consistent theming and accessibility features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ui-mobile package is updated THEN it SHALL use @eva-design/eva and @ui-kitten/components as the foundation
2. WHEN components are rendered THEN they SHALL follow Eva Design principles and visual guidelines
3. WHEN themes are applied THEN they SHALL use Eva Design's theming system with custom mappings
4. WHEN accessibility features are used THEN they SHALL leverage Eva Design's built-in accessibility support
5. IF existing components exist THEN the new Eva-based components SHALL maintain the same public API surface for backward compatibility

### Requirement 2: Style Dictionary Integration

**User Story:** As a design system maintainer, I want Style Dictionary integrated into the build process, so that design tokens can be managed centrally and generated into multiple formats for consistent theming across platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Style Dictionary is configured THEN it SHALL generate design tokens from source JSON files
2. WHEN tokens are generated THEN they SHALL output Eva Design compatible theme files
3. WHEN the build process runs THEN Style Dictionary SHALL automatically generate updated token files
4. WHEN tokens change THEN the generated files SHALL be automatically updated and type-safe
5. IF platform-specific tokens are needed THEN Style Dictionary SHALL generate appropriate formats for React Native and web

### Requirement 3: Component Library Modernization

**User Story:** As a mobile developer, I want all existing components to be rebuilt using Eva Design components as the foundation, so that I get consistent styling, theming, and behavior across the entire component library.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing components are rebuilt THEN they SHALL use UI Kitten components as base components
2. WHEN component props are defined THEN they SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing APIs
3. WHEN components are styled THEN they SHALL use Eva Design mapping and theming system
4. WHEN components are tested THEN they SHALL pass all existing tests without modification
5. IF new Eva Design features are available THEN components SHALL leverage them for enhanced functionality

### Requirement 4: Theme System Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an enhanced theme system that leverages Eva Design's theming capabilities, so that I can easily customize the appearance of components while maintaining design consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN themes are defined THEN they SHALL extend Eva Design's default themes (light/dark)
2. WHEN custom themes are created THEN they SHALL follow Eva Design's theme structure and mapping system
3. WHEN theme switching occurs THEN it SHALL use Eva Design's ApplicationProvider for seamless transitions
4. WHEN theme tokens are accessed THEN they SHALL be type-safe and auto-completed in IDEs
5. IF custom brand colors are needed THEN they SHALL be properly integrated into Eva Design's color system

### Requirement 5: Build System Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build system to automatically generate design tokens and Eva Design themes, so that the design system stays in sync with token changes and requires minimal manual maintenance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs THEN Style Dictionary SHALL generate Eva Design compatible theme files
2. WHEN tokens are updated THEN the build SHALL automatically regenerate all dependent files
3. WHEN TypeScript compilation occurs THEN generated token types SHALL be included and type-safe
4. WHEN the package is built THEN all Eva Design dependencies SHALL be properly bundled
5. IF token validation fails THEN the build SHALL fail with clear error messages

### Requirement 6: Mobile App Integration

**User Story:** As a mobile app developer, I want the mobile app to seamlessly use the new Eva Design-based UI components, so that I get improved theming, accessibility, and visual consistency without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the mobile app imports UI components THEN it SHALL use the new Eva Design-based components
2. WHEN the app renders THEN it SHALL be wrapped with Eva Design's ApplicationProvider
3. WHEN themes are applied THEN they SHALL work consistently across all components
4. WHEN the app is tested THEN all existing functionality SHALL continue to work
5. IF Eva Design icons are used THEN they SHALL be properly configured and accessible

### Requirement 7: Documentation and Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation for the new Eva Design-based system, so that I can understand how to use the enhanced components and migrate existing code if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is updated THEN it SHALL include Eva Design integration details
2. WHEN migration guides are provided THEN they SHALL cover breaking changes and upgrade paths
3. WHEN examples are shown THEN they SHALL demonstrate Eva Design theming and customization
4. WHEN Storybook stories are updated THEN they SHALL showcase Eva Design capabilities
5. IF breaking changes exist THEN they SHALL be clearly documented with migration instructions

### Requirement 8: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want all existing tests to pass with the new Eva Design implementation, so that I can be confident that the migration maintains existing functionality and quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests run THEN they SHALL pass without modification for public API compatibility
2. WHEN visual regression tests run THEN they SHALL be updated to reflect Eva Design styling
3. WHEN accessibility tests run THEN they SHALL pass with improved Eva Design accessibility features
4. WHEN performance tests run THEN they SHALL show no degradation in component performance
5. IF new Eva Design features are tested THEN appropriate test coverage SHALL be added
