# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on implementing comprehensive Storybook stories for all existing and future components in both the ui-web and ui-mobile packages. The goal is to provide a robust component development and documentation environment where developers can view, test, and interact with components in isolation. Each package will have its own Storybook instance running on dedicated ports to avoid conflicts and provide clear separation between web and mobile component libraries.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view and interact with all ui-web components in Storybook, so that I can develop and test components in isolation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the ui-web Storybook THEN it SHALL start on port 6007
2. WHEN I access the ui-web Storybook THEN it SHALL display all existing components with their stories
3. WHEN I view a component story THEN it SHALL show different variants and states of the component
4. WHEN I interact with component controls THEN it SHALL allow me to modify props and see real-time updates

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view and interact with all ui-mobile components in Storybook, so that I can develop and test React Native components in isolation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the ui-mobile Storybook THEN it SHALL start on port 6006
2. WHEN I access the ui-mobile Storybook THEN it SHALL display all existing React Native components with their stories
3. WHEN I view a mobile component story THEN it SHALL show different variants and states appropriate for mobile interfaces
4. WHEN I interact with component controls THEN it SHALL allow me to modify props and see real-time updates for React Native components

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing components to have comprehensive Storybook stories, so that I can understand component usage and behavior without reading source code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I examine any existing component in ui-web THEN it SHALL have at least one default story
2. WHEN I examine any existing component in ui-mobile THEN it SHALL have at least one default story
3. WHEN a component has multiple variants or states THEN it SHALL have separate stories for each significant variant
4. WHEN a component accepts props THEN the stories SHALL demonstrate different prop combinations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a standardized story template for future components, so that new components consistently include proper Storybook documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a new component in ui-web THEN I SHALL have a clear template to follow for creating its story
2. WHEN I create a new component in ui-mobile THEN I SHALL have a clear template to follow for creating its story
3. WHEN I follow the story template THEN it SHALL include proper TypeScript types and controls
4. WHEN I follow the story template THEN it SHALL include accessibility considerations and documentation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want both Storybook instances to run independently, so that I can work on web and mobile components simultaneously without conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start both Storybook instances THEN they SHALL run on different ports (6006 for mobile, 6007 for web)
2. WHEN both instances are running THEN they SHALL not interfere with each other
3. WHEN I make changes to a component THEN only the relevant Storybook instance SHALL hot-reload
4. WHEN I run package-specific commands THEN they SHALL only affect the intended package

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper Storybook configuration for both packages, so that stories render correctly with appropriate styling and context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ui-web stories render THEN they SHALL include Tailwind CSS styling
2. WHEN ui-mobile stories render THEN they SHALL include appropriate React Native styling context
3. WHEN stories load THEN they SHALL have proper TypeScript support and IntelliSense
4. WHEN I view stories THEN they SHALL include proper documentation and component descriptions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run Storybook commands from the monorepo root, so that I can easily start either Storybook instance without navigating to specific packages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run a command from the root THEN I SHALL be able to start ui-web Storybook
2. WHEN I run a command from the root THEN I SHALL be able to start ui-mobile Storybook
3. WHEN I run a command from the root THEN I SHALL be able to build both Storybook instances
4. WHEN I run commands THEN they SHALL be properly configured in the root package.json scripts
