# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Transform the `packages/ui-web` package into a comprehensive design system that serves as the single source of truth for all UI components, design tokens, and styling patterns used in `apps/web`. This design system will establish consistency, maintainability, and scalability across the web application by centralizing all visual design decisions and providing a complete component library with proper documentation and testing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on the web application, I want a comprehensive design system with standardized design tokens, so that I can build consistent UIs without hardcoding values.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to use colors THEN the design system SHALL provide a complete color palette with semantic naming
2. WHEN I need to use typography THEN the design system SHALL provide standardized font sizes, weights, and line heights
3. WHEN I need to use spacing THEN the design system SHALL provide a consistent spacing scale for margins, padding, and gaps
4. WHEN I need to use border radius THEN the design system SHALL provide standardized radius values
5. WHEN I need to use shadows THEN the design system SHALL provide a consistent shadow system
6. IF I need to use breakpoints THEN the design system SHALL provide standardized responsive breakpoints

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all UI components to be available in the design system with proper TypeScript interfaces and variants, so that I can build interfaces efficiently without creating custom components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need form components THEN the design system SHALL provide Input, Textarea, Select, Checkbox, Radio, and Label components
2. WHEN I need interactive components THEN the design system SHALL provide Button, IconButton, Link, and Toggle components
3. WHEN I need layout components THEN the design system SHALL provide Card, Container, Stack, Grid, and Divider components
4. WHEN I need feedback components THEN the design system SHALL provide Badge, Alert, Toast, Loading, and Progress components
5. WHEN I need navigation components THEN the design system SHALL provide Breadcrumb, Tabs, and Pagination components
6. WHEN I need overlay components THEN the design system SHALL provide Dialog, Popover, Tooltip, and Dropdown components
7. IF a component has multiple visual styles THEN the design system SHALL provide variant props with proper TypeScript types

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive Storybook documentation for all components, so that I can understand how to use each component and see all available variants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view a component in Storybook THEN I SHALL see all available variants and states
2. WHEN I view a component story THEN I SHALL see proper documentation with props table and usage examples
3. WHEN I need to understand design tokens THEN Storybook SHALL provide a dedicated section showing all tokens
4. WHEN I need to copy component code THEN Storybook SHALL provide code examples for each variant
5. IF a component has accessibility features THEN the story SHALL document and demonstrate them

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the web application to use only design system components and tokens, so that the UI is consistent and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I examine web app components THEN they SHALL use only design system components and tokens
2. WHEN I look for hardcoded styling values THEN there SHALL be none in the web application code
3. WHEN I need custom styling THEN it SHALL be built using design system tokens as CSS custom properties
4. IF the web app needs a new component THEN it SHALL first be created in the design system
5. WHEN I update a design token THEN it SHALL automatically update throughout the web application

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper TypeScript support and tree-shaking for the design system, so that I get type safety and optimal bundle sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I import components THEN I SHALL get full TypeScript intellisense and type checking
2. WHEN I build the web application THEN only used design system components SHALL be included in the bundle
3. WHEN I use design tokens THEN they SHALL have proper TypeScript types
4. IF I misuse a component prop THEN TypeScript SHALL show an error
5. WHEN I import the design system THEN it SHALL provide proper ESM and CJS exports

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing for all design system components, so that I can trust they work correctly and maintain quality over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run tests THEN all components SHALL have unit tests covering functionality and accessibility
2. WHEN I run visual regression tests THEN all component variants SHALL be tested for visual consistency
3. WHEN I make changes to components THEN tests SHALL catch breaking changes
4. IF a component has interactive behavior THEN it SHALL have integration tests
5. WHEN I check test coverage THEN it SHALL be at least 90% for all component code

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the design system to support theming and dark mode, so that the web application can provide multiple visual themes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I switch themes THEN all components SHALL update their appearance accordingly
2. WHEN I use dark mode THEN all components SHALL have appropriate dark mode styling
3. WHEN I define custom themes THEN the design system SHALL support theme customization
4. IF I need theme-aware styling THEN the design system SHALL provide theme context and hooks
5. WHEN themes change THEN there SHALL be smooth transitions between theme states
