# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves modernizing the entire monorepo project to use the latest stable technologies, fixing compilation issues, and ensuring all linting passes. The modernization includes updating Node.js to the latest LTS, upgrading all dependencies to their latest non-deprecated versions, installing missing blockchain development tools (particularly Anchor for Solana), and resolving all ESLint failures across the codebase.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project to use the latest Node.js LTS version, so that I can benefit from the latest performance improvements, security patches, and language features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is set up THEN the system SHALL use Node.js LTS version as specified in .nvmrc
2. WHEN nvm is available THEN the system SHALL install and configure the latest Node.js LTS
3. WHEN the Node.js version is updated THEN all applications SHALL compile and run successfully
4. WHEN the changelog is updated THEN it SHALL reflect the Node.js version upgrade

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all Node.js dependencies updated to their latest non-deprecated versions, so that I can have access to the latest features, security patches, and performance improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependency updates are performed THEN the system SHALL upgrade all packages to their latest stable versions
2. WHEN deprecated packages are found THEN the system SHALL replace them with modern alternatives
3. WHEN package.json files are updated THEN they SHALL maintain compatibility across the monorepo
4. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN all build processes SHALL continue to work
5. WHEN pnpm lockfile is regenerated THEN it SHALL reflect the new dependency versions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a blockchain developer, I want Anchor CLI and all Solana development tools properly installed, so that I can compile and deploy Solana smart contracts successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Anchor CLI is missing THEN the system SHALL install the latest stable version
2. WHEN Solana CLI tools are needed THEN they SHALL be properly installed and configured
3. WHEN Rust toolchain is required THEN it SHALL be installed with the correct version for Solana development
4. WHEN Solana contracts are compiled THEN they SHALL build without errors
5. WHEN Anchor programs are built THEN they SHALL generate the correct artifacts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a blockchain developer, I want all smart contract compilation to work across all supported networks, so that I can develop and deploy contracts on Polygon, Solana, and Polkadot.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Polygon contracts are compiled THEN Hardhat SHALL build Solidity contracts successfully
2. WHEN Solana programs are compiled THEN Anchor SHALL build Rust programs successfully
3. WHEN Polkadot pallets are compiled THEN Substrate SHALL build successfully
4. WHEN Rust dependencies are missing THEN Cargo SHALL install all required dependencies
5. WHEN compilation errors occur THEN they SHALL be resolved with proper toolchain setup

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all ESLint errors resolved across the codebase, so that code quality standards are maintained and the build process passes all linting checks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ESLint is run THEN it SHALL pass without errors across all packages and applications
2. WHEN unused declarations are found THEN they SHALL be removed unless explicitly required by the code file's purpose
3. WHEN ESLint rules conflict with necessary code patterns THEN appropriate eslint-disable comments SHALL be added with justification
4. WHEN linting configuration is outdated THEN it SHALL be updated to work with the latest ESLint version
5. WHEN TypeScript errors cause ESLint failures THEN they SHALL be resolved

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the changelog properly updated to reflect all modernization changes, so that I can track what has been updated and understand the impact of changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modernization is complete THEN the changelog SHALL document all major version updates
2. WHEN breaking changes are introduced THEN they SHALL be clearly documented in the changelog
3. WHEN new tools are installed THEN they SHALL be mentioned in the changelog
4. WHEN the changelog is updated THEN it SHALL follow the established format and conventions
