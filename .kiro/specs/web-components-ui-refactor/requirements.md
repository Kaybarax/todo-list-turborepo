# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring the web application's component architecture to follow proper design system principles. Currently, the `apps/web` application contains several components that should be moved to the `packages/ui-web` design system package to promote reusability, consistency, and maintainability across the monorepo. The goal is to identify and migrate reusable UI components from the web app to the design system, ensuring they come with proper Storybook stories, tests, and documentation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Component Analysis and Categorization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to clearly understand which components should remain in the web app versus which should be moved to the design system, so that I can maintain proper separation of concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing web app components THEN the system SHALL categorize components into three groups: business logic components (stay in web app), reusable UI components (move to ui-web), and theme/provider components (move to ui-web)
2. WHEN identifying reusable components THEN the system SHALL prioritize components that could be used across multiple applications or contexts
3. WHEN evaluating components THEN the system SHALL consider components that contain minimal business logic and maximum UI presentation logic as candidates for ui-web
4. WHEN categorizing components THEN the system SHALL identify components that are tightly coupled to specific business domains as candidates to remain in the web app

### Requirement 2: Todo-Specific Component Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want todo-related UI components to be available in the design system, so that they can be reused across different applications that need todo functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating TodoForm THEN the system SHALL create a generic, reusable form component in ui-web with proper prop interfaces for customization
2. WHEN migrating TodoItem THEN the system SHALL create a flexible todo item component that accepts todo data and callback functions as props
3. WHEN migrating TodoList THEN the system SHALL create a reusable list component with filtering, sorting, and search capabilities
4. WHEN creating todo components THEN the system SHALL ensure they are decoupled from specific state management implementations
5. WHEN migrating todo components THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality while making them more generic and reusable

### Requirement 3: Blockchain Component Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want blockchain-related UI components to be available in the design system, so that they can be reused across different blockchain applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating BlockchainStats THEN the system SHALL create a generic statistics display component that accepts data and configuration props
2. WHEN migrating TransactionStatus THEN the system SHALL create a reusable transaction status component that works with different blockchain networks
3. WHEN migrating WalletConnect THEN the system SHALL create a flexible wallet connection component that supports multiple wallet types and networks
4. WHEN creating blockchain components THEN the system SHALL ensure they work with the existing @todo/services blockchain abstractions
5. WHEN migrating blockchain components THEN the system SHALL maintain network-specific styling and behavior while keeping the components generic

### Requirement 4: Theme Component Consolidation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified theme system across the monorepo, so that all applications can share consistent theming capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN consolidating theme components THEN the system SHALL merge the web app's ThemeProvider with the existing ui-web ThemeProvider
2. WHEN merging theme providers THEN the system SHALL ensure backward compatibility with existing theme functionality
3. WHEN creating unified theme components THEN the system SHALL support both DaisyUI themes and custom theme configurations
4. WHEN consolidating theme switchers THEN the system SHALL provide multiple variants (dropdown, toggle, buttons) for different use cases
5. WHEN updating theme components THEN the system SHALL ensure proper TypeScript types and comprehensive theme validation

### Requirement 5: Component Structure and Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all migrated components to follow consistent patterns and have comprehensive documentation, so that they are easy to use and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating components THEN the system SHALL create proper directory structure with component, stories, tests, and index files
2. WHEN creating component stories THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive Storybook stories covering all variants and use cases
3. WHEN writing component tests THEN the system SHALL include unit tests, integration tests, and accessibility tests
4. WHEN documenting components THEN the system SHALL provide clear prop interfaces, usage examples, and API documentation
5. WHEN organizing components THEN the system SHALL group related components into logical categories (todo, blockchain, theme)

### Requirement 6: Import Path Updates and Dependencies

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the web application to seamlessly import components from the design system, so that the refactoring doesn't break existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating components THEN the system SHALL update all import statements in the web app to use @todo/ui-web imports
2. WHEN updating imports THEN the system SHALL ensure no circular dependencies are created between packages
3. WHEN refactoring components THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing prop interfaces and component APIs
4. WHEN updating dependencies THEN the system SHALL ensure the web app properly depends on the updated ui-web package
5. WHEN completing migration THEN the system SHALL remove the original component files from the web app

### Requirement 7: Visual Regression and Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure that the component migration doesn't introduce visual regressions or break existing functionality, so that the user experience remains consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating components THEN the system SHALL run visual regression tests to ensure UI consistency
2. WHEN updating components THEN the system SHALL verify that all existing tests continue to pass
3. WHEN creating new component tests THEN the system SHALL achieve minimum 80% code coverage
4. WHEN testing components THEN the system SHALL include accessibility testing with proper ARIA attributes
5. WHEN validating migration THEN the system SHALL ensure the web app builds and runs successfully with the new component imports

### Requirement 8: Performance and Bundle Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the component migration to maintain or improve application performance, so that the refactoring provides value beyond just code organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating components THEN the system SHALL ensure tree-shaking works properly for unused components
2. WHEN organizing components THEN the system SHALL optimize bundle size by avoiding unnecessary dependencies
3. WHEN creating component exports THEN the system SHALL use proper ES module exports for optimal bundling
4. WHEN updating ui-web package THEN the system SHALL maintain or improve build performance
5. WHEN completing migration THEN the system SHALL verify that the web app bundle size doesn't increase significantly
