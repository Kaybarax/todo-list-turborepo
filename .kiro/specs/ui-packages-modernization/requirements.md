# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature modernizes the UI component architecture in the monorepo by establishing proper foundation libraries for both web and mobile UI packages. The web package will use Radix UI as its foundation, while the mobile package will use UI Kitten. Additionally, both packages will include showcase applications to demonstrate all available components - a React Vite app for web and an Expo React Native drawer app for mobile. All components used in the main applications must come from their respective UI package libraries.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the web UI package to use Radix UI as its foundation, so that I have access to accessible, unstyled components that can be customized consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing web UI components THEN the system SHALL use Radix UI primitives as the foundation
2. WHEN a Radix UI component doesn't need customization THEN the system SHALL create a simple wrapper component with Storybook stories
3. WHEN a Radix UI component needs customization THEN the system SHALL extend it appropriately while maintaining accessibility
4. WHEN components are created THEN the system SHALL include TypeScript definitions and proper exports
5. WHEN components are created THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive tests in **tests**/components directory

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the mobile UI package to use UI Kitten as its foundation, so that I have access to a comprehensive React Native component library.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing mobile UI components THEN the system SHALL use UI Kitten components as the foundation
2. WHEN a UI Kitten component doesn't need customization THEN the system SHALL create a simple wrapper component with Storybook stories
3. WHEN a UI Kitten component needs customization THEN the system SHALL extend it appropriately while maintaining React Native compatibility
4. WHEN components are created THEN the system SHALL include TypeScript definitions and proper exports
5. WHEN components are created THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive tests in **tests**/components directory

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all components in the main applications to come from their respective UI packages, so that there is a single source of truth for UI components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the web application needs UI components THEN it SHALL import them from packages/ui-web
2. WHEN the mobile application needs UI components THEN it SHALL import them from packages/ui-mobile
3. WHEN components are duplicated between apps and packages THEN the system SHALL remove duplicates and use package versions
4. WHEN new components are needed THEN they SHALL be created in the appropriate UI package first
5. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL be placed in lib/components directory with tests in **tests**/components

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the web UI package to include a React Vite showcase application, so that I can view and test all available web components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the web UI package is run THEN it SHALL display a React Vite application
2. WHEN the showcase app loads THEN it SHALL display all components from packages/ui-web
3. WHEN viewing components THEN each SHALL be properly rendered with examples
4. WHEN components have variants THEN all variants SHALL be demonstrated
5. WHEN the showcase runs THEN it SHALL be accessible via a development server

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the mobile UI package to include an Expo React Native drawer showcase application, so that I can view and test all available mobile components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the mobile UI package is run THEN it SHALL display an Expo React Native application
2. WHEN the showcase app loads THEN it SHALL present a drawer navigation interface
3. WHEN clicking drawer items THEN each SHALL navigate to the respective component demonstration
4. WHEN viewing components THEN each SHALL be properly rendered with examples on mobile
5. WHEN components have variants THEN all variants SHALL be demonstrated
6. WHEN the showcase runs THEN it SHALL be accessible via Expo development tools

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want updated documentation reflecting the new UI architecture, so that I understand how to use and contribute to the UI packages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is updated THEN it SHALL reflect the new Radix UI foundation for web components
2. WHEN documentation is updated THEN it SHALL reflect the new UI Kitten foundation for mobile components
3. WHEN documentation is updated THEN it SHALL include instructions for running showcase applications
4. WHEN documentation is updated THEN it SHALL include guidelines for creating new components
5. WHEN documentation is updated THEN it SHALL include import/usage examples for both packages
6. WHEN documentation is updated THEN it SHALL reflect the lib/components directory structure and **tests** testing approach
