# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves identifying and replacing all deprecated pnpm dependencies across the monorepo with their non-deprecated versions, and updating all related code that may be affected by these dependency changes. The goal is to achieve zero deprecated dependencies while maintaining full functionality and compatibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all deprecated dependencies to be replaced with their modern alternatives, so that the project remains secure and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning the monorepo THEN the system SHALL identify all deprecated dependencies including:
   - `@testing-library/jest-native` (deprecated)
   - `react-native-testing-library` (deprecated) 
   - `react-native-vector-icons` (deprecated)

2. WHEN replacing deprecated dependencies THEN the system SHALL find appropriate non-deprecated alternatives for each package

3. WHEN updating dependencies THEN the system SHALL ensure all package.json files are updated with the new versions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all code that depends on deprecated packages to be updated accordingly, so that the application continues to function correctly after the dependency updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deprecated dependencies are replaced THEN the system SHALL identify all import statements that reference the old packages

2. WHEN updating imports THEN the system SHALL replace all import statements with the correct new package names and APIs

3. WHEN updating code THEN the system SHALL ensure all TypeScript types and interfaces are updated to match the new packages

4. WHEN updating configuration THEN the system SHALL update all configuration files (Jest, ESLint, etc.) that reference the deprecated packages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all outdated dependencies to be updated to their latest stable versions, so that the project benefits from bug fixes and security improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating dependencies THEN the system SHALL update all packages to their latest stable versions where possible

2. WHEN updating major versions THEN the system SHALL identify and handle breaking changes appropriately

3. WHEN updating dependencies THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility between related packages (e.g., React and React DOM versions should match)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build and test processes to continue working after dependency updates, so that the development workflow is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN all build scripts SHALL continue to work without errors

2. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN all test suites SHALL continue to pass

3. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN all linting and formatting tools SHALL continue to work correctly

4. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN all Storybook instances SHALL continue to function properly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want security vulnerabilities to be resolved through dependency updates, so that the application is secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating dependencies THEN the system SHALL resolve all high and moderate security vulnerabilities identified in the audit

2. WHEN security vulnerabilities cannot be resolved through updates THEN the system SHALL document the remaining vulnerabilities and provide mitigation strategies

3. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN a new security audit SHALL show zero high-priority vulnerabilities
