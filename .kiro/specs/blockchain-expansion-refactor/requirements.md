# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves expanding blockchain network support and refactoring the project structure. The project currently supports Polkadot pallets, Solana, and Polygon networks. We need to add support for Polkadot Moonbeam (EVM-compatible) and Base network (Coinbase's L2), while also refactoring the "blockchain-smart-contracts" directory to "smart-contracts" and updating all references throughout the monorepo.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the smart contracts directory to be renamed from "blockchain-smart-contracts" to "smart-contracts", so that the naming is more concise and follows better conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the directory "apps/blockchain-smart-contracts" SHALL be renamed to "apps/smart-contracts"
2. WHEN any file references the old path THEN it SHALL be updated to reference the new path
3. WHEN package.json scripts reference the old path THEN they SHALL be updated to use the new path
4. WHEN documentation references the old path THEN it SHALL be updated to reflect the new structure
5. WHEN Docker configurations reference the old path THEN they SHALL be updated accordingly
6. WHEN Kubernetes manifests reference the old path THEN they SHALL be updated to use the new path

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a blockchain developer, I want to add Polkadot Moonbeam network support, so that I can deploy EVM-compatible smart contracts on the Polkadot ecosystem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Moonbeam support is implemented THEN there SHALL be a new "moonbeam" directory under "apps/smart-contracts/"
2. WHEN Moonbeam contracts are created THEN they SHALL use Solidity with Hardhat configuration
3. WHEN Moonbeam is configured THEN it SHALL support EVM-compatible smart contract deployment
4. WHEN Moonbeam integration is complete THEN it SHALL include TodoList and TodoListFactory contracts
5. WHEN Moonbeam network is added THEN it SHALL have proper test coverage for contract functionality
6. WHEN Moonbeam deployment scripts are created THEN they SHALL support development, testnet, and mainnet environments

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a blockchain developer, I want to add Base network support, so that I can deploy smart contracts on Coinbase's Layer 2 solution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Base support is implemented THEN there SHALL be a new "base" directory under "apps/smart-contracts/"
2. WHEN Base contracts are created THEN they SHALL use Solidity with Hardhat configuration
3. WHEN Base is configured THEN it SHALL support Layer 2 optimized smart contract deployment
4. WHEN Base integration is complete THEN it SHALL include TodoList and TodoListFactory contracts
5. WHEN Base network is added THEN it SHALL have proper test coverage for contract functionality
6. WHEN Base deployment scripts are created THEN they SHALL support development, testnet, and mainnet environments

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the blockchain service factory to support the new networks, so that the application can interact with Moonbeam and Base contracts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new networks are added THEN the BlockchainServiceFactory SHALL support Moonbeam network type
2. WHEN new networks are added THEN the BlockchainServiceFactory SHALL support Base network type
3. WHEN network services are created THEN they SHALL implement the existing blockchain service interface
4. WHEN new network services are integrated THEN they SHALL support all existing todo operations (create, read, update, delete)
5. WHEN wallet connections are established THEN they SHALL work with Moonbeam and Base networks

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the web and mobile applications to support the new blockchain networks, so that I can choose to store my todos on Moonbeam or Base networks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network selection is available THEN Moonbeam SHALL appear as an option
2. WHEN network selection is available THEN Base SHALL appear as an option
3. WHEN a user selects Moonbeam THEN the application SHALL connect to the appropriate Moonbeam RPC endpoint
4. WHEN a user selects Base THEN the application SHALL connect to the appropriate Base RPC endpoint
5. WHEN transactions are submitted THEN they SHALL be properly formatted for the selected network
6. WHEN wallet connections are made THEN they SHALL support the network-specific requirements

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want all build and deployment scripts to work with the refactored structure, so that CI/CD pipelines continue to function correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN build scripts are updated THEN they SHALL reference the new "smart-contracts" path
2. WHEN deployment scripts are executed THEN they SHALL deploy contracts to all supported networks including Moonbeam and Base
3. WHEN Docker builds are run THEN they SHALL use the correct directory structure
4. WHEN Kubernetes deployments are applied THEN they SHALL reference the updated paths
5. WHEN CI/CD pipelines run THEN they SHALL successfully build and test all components
6. WHEN package scripts are executed THEN they SHALL work with the new directory structure

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation updates, so that the new structure and networks are properly documented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is updated THEN all README files SHALL reflect the new directory structure
2. WHEN network documentation is created THEN it SHALL include setup instructions for Moonbeam
3. WHEN network documentation is created THEN it SHALL include setup instructions for Base
4. WHEN API documentation is updated THEN it SHALL include the new network options
5. WHEN deployment guides are updated THEN they SHALL cover all five supported networks
6. WHEN troubleshooting guides are updated THEN they SHALL include network-specific issues and solutions
