# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the blockchain development environment setup issues, specifically focusing on fixing smart contract compilation failures and ensuring proper installation of required tools like Anchor CLI for Solana development. The goal is to create a robust, automated setup process that ensures all blockchain development dependencies are properly installed and configured across different networks (Polygon, Solana, Polkadot).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a blockchain developer, I want the smart contract compilation process to automatically detect and install missing dependencies, so that I can compile contracts without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build script runs THEN the system SHALL check for required blockchain development tools before attempting compilation
2. WHEN Anchor CLI is missing THEN the system SHALL automatically install it using the correct installation method
3. WHEN any blockchain tool is missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with installation instructions
4. WHEN all dependencies are present THEN the compilation SHALL proceed successfully for all supported networks

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive dependency check script, so that I can verify my blockchain development environment is properly configured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dependency check runs THEN the system SHALL verify the presence of Node.js, Rust, Solana CLI, and Anchor CLI
2. WHEN a dependency is missing THEN the system SHALL provide specific installation instructions for the current operating system
3. WHEN all dependencies are present THEN the system SHALL display version information for each tool
4. WHEN running on different operating systems THEN the system SHALL adapt installation commands accordingly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build scripts to be resilient to environment differences, so that compilation works consistently across different development machines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build script encounters missing tools THEN it SHALL attempt automatic installation before failing
2. WHEN automatic installation fails THEN the system SHALL provide manual installation instructions
3. WHEN compilation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and troubleshooting steps
4. WHEN running in CI/CD environments THEN the system SHALL handle non-interactive installation scenarios

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging in the build process, so that I can quickly identify and resolve compilation issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any step in the build process fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN dependencies are being installed THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators
3. WHEN compilation succeeds THEN the system SHALL confirm successful builds for each network
4. WHEN partial failures occur THEN the system SHALL continue with successful networks and report which ones failed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the blockchain development environment to be documented and easily reproducible, so that new team members can quickly get started.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the development environment THEN there SHALL be clear documentation for all required tools
2. WHEN following the setup instructions THEN a new developer SHALL be able to compile all contracts successfully
3. WHEN environment issues occur THEN there SHALL be troubleshooting guides available
4. WHEN using different operating systems THEN there SHALL be platform-specific setup instructions
