# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a comprehensive Playwright automation system for the ui-mobile Storybook stories. The system will automatically verify that all Storybook stories render correctly, perform accessibility checks, and validate component functionality. It will include a unified script to start Storybook and run the automation tests, along with all necessary dependencies and Docker configurations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an automated Playwright test suite that validates all ui-mobile Storybook stories render correctly, so that I can ensure component quality and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Playwright automation runs THEN it SHALL discover and test all existing Storybook stories in the ui-mobile package
2. WHEN testing each story THEN the system SHALL verify that the story renders without errors
3. WHEN testing each story THEN the system SHALL capture screenshots for visual regression testing
4. WHEN a story fails to render THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information including component name and failure reason
5. WHEN all tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive test report with pass/fail status for each story

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Playwright automation to perform accessibility testing on all stories, so that I can ensure our components meet accessibility standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing each story THEN the system SHALL run axe-core accessibility checks
2. WHEN accessibility violations are found THEN the system SHALL report specific violations with severity levels
3. WHEN testing stories THEN the system SHALL verify proper ARIA labels and roles are present
4. WHEN testing interactive components THEN the system SHALL verify keyboard navigation works correctly
5. WHEN accessibility tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate an accessibility report with detailed findings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single script that starts Storybook and runs the Playwright tests, so that I can easily execute the full test suite with one command.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the unified script is executed THEN it SHALL start the ui-mobile Storybook server
2. WHEN Storybook is ready THEN the script SHALL automatically begin Playwright test execution
3. WHEN tests complete THEN the script SHALL stop the Storybook server and clean up resources
4. WHEN the script encounters errors THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages and exit gracefully
5. WHEN the script completes THEN it SHALL return appropriate exit codes for CI/CD integration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all necessary dependencies installed and Docker configurations updated, so that the Playwright automation works in all environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the automation THEN all required Playwright dependencies SHALL be installed in the ui-mobile package
2. WHEN setting up the automation THEN all required accessibility testing dependencies SHALL be installed
3. WHEN updating Docker configurations THEN the Dockerfile SHALL include Playwright browser dependencies
4. WHEN running in Docker THEN the automation SHALL work with headless browser configurations
5. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN package.json SHALL be updated with appropriate scripts and dependencies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the automation to test different device viewports and themes, so that I can ensure components work across various configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing stories THEN the system SHALL test multiple device viewports (mobile, tablet, desktop)
2. WHEN testing stories THEN the system SHALL test both light and dark themes
3. WHEN testing responsive components THEN the system SHALL verify layout adapts correctly to different screen sizes
4. WHEN testing themed components THEN the system SHALL verify proper color and styling application
5. WHEN viewport/theme tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate reports showing results across all configurations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the automation to integrate with existing CI/CD pipelines, so that story validation runs automatically on code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring for CI THEN the automation SHALL support headless execution
2. WHEN running in CI THEN the automation SHALL generate JUnit XML reports for integration
3. WHEN running in CI THEN the automation SHALL upload test artifacts (screenshots, reports)
4. WHEN tests fail in CI THEN the automation SHALL provide actionable error messages
5. WHEN integrating with existing workflows THEN the automation SHALL respect existing timeout and retry configurations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the automation to validate component interactions and state changes, so that I can ensure interactive components work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing interactive stories THEN the system SHALL simulate user interactions (clicks, typing, gestures)
2. WHEN testing stateful components THEN the system SHALL verify state changes occur correctly
3. WHEN testing form components THEN the system SHALL validate input handling and validation
4. WHEN testing navigation components THEN the system SHALL verify routing and navigation behavior
5. WHEN interaction tests complete THEN the system SHALL report on component behavior and any failures

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the automation to be maintainable and extensible, so that new stories and test scenarios can be easily added.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new stories THEN the automation SHALL automatically discover and test them without configuration changes
2. WHEN creating custom test scenarios THEN the system SHALL provide a clear API for extending test behavior
3. WHEN maintaining the test suite THEN the code SHALL be well-documented with clear examples
4. WHEN debugging test failures THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging and debugging information
5. WHEN updating the automation THEN changes SHALL not break existing test configurations
