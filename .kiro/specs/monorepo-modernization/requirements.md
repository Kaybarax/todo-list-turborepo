# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves a comprehensive modernization and restructuring of a multi-application monorepo to create a fully functional todo application ecosystem with blockchain integration. The project includes web and mobile frontends, a NestJS API backend, blockchain contracts for multiple networks (Solana, Polkadot, Polygon), wallet connectivity, Redis caching, and comprehensive testing coverage across all applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a properly configured monorepo with modern tooling, so that I can develop and maintain multiple applications efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is initialized THEN pnpm SHALL be used as the package manager across all applications
2. WHEN building the project THEN all applications SHALL build successfully without errors
3. WHEN running development mode THEN all applications SHALL start and run concurrently
4. WHEN examining the workspace THEN proper TypeScript configuration SHALL be present for all applications

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want a modern web application interface, so that I can manage my todos through a responsive web interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the web application THEN it SHALL be built with Next.js framework
2. WHEN the web app loads THEN it SHALL display a functional todo list interface
3. WHEN interacting with todos THEN the interface SHALL support create, read, update, and delete operations
4. WHEN using the web app THEN it SHALL integrate with the shared UI component library

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want a native mobile application, so that I can manage my todos on my mobile device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the mobile app is initialized THEN it SHALL be built with Expo React Native
2. WHEN the mobile app runs THEN it SHALL provide the same todo functionality as the web app
3. WHEN building the mobile app THEN it SHALL use shared UI components from the mobile UI package
4. WHEN deploying the mobile app THEN it SHALL be compatible with both iOS and Android platforms

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust API backend, so that all frontend applications can reliably interact with data and services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API is implemented THEN it SHALL be built with NestJS framework
2. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN they SHALL provide full CRUD operations for todos
3. WHEN the API processes requests THEN it SHALL integrate with MongoDB for data persistence
4. WHEN the API handles errors THEN it SHALL provide appropriate error responses and logging

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to store my todos on blockchain networks, so that my data is decentralized and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN blockchain contracts are deployed THEN they SHALL support Solana, Polkadot, and Polygon networks
2. WHEN users interact with blockchain features THEN smart contracts SHALL handle todo storage and retrieval
3. WHEN contracts are executed THEN they SHALL maintain data integrity and security
4. WHEN deploying contracts THEN proper deployment scripts SHALL be available for each network

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to connect my crypto wallet, so that I can interact with blockchain features securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access wallet features THEN WalletConnect service SHALL be integrated in both web and mobile apps
2. WHEN connecting a wallet THEN users SHALL be able to authenticate with supported wallet providers
3. WHEN wallet is connected THEN users SHALL be able to save todos to their chosen blockchain network
4. WHEN blockchain transactions occur THEN proper transaction handling and feedback SHALL be provided

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want shared UI component libraries, so that I can maintain consistency across web and mobile applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building web UI components THEN they SHALL be built with React and Vite
2. WHEN building mobile UI components THEN they SHALL be built with Expo React Native but packaged with Vite
3. WHEN components are used THEN they SHALL be properly exported as reusable node libraries
4. WHEN styling components THEN consistent theming SHALL be applied across platforms

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Redis caching integration, so that the application can handle data efficiently with improved performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Redis is configured THEN it SHALL be properly integrated into the API application
2. WHEN caching data THEN frequently accessed todo data SHALL be stored in Redis
3. WHEN Redis is running THEN it SHALL be accessible through Docker configuration
4. WHEN cache operations occur THEN proper error handling and fallback mechanisms SHALL be implemented

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing coverage, so that I can ensure code quality and reliability across all applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN unit tests SHALL cover all business logic and components
2. WHEN running integration tests THEN API endpoints and database interactions SHALL be tested
3. WHEN running e2e tests THEN Playwright SHALL be used for web application testing
4. WHEN running mobile tests THEN appropriate React Native testing libraries SHALL be used
5. WHEN examining test coverage THEN all tests SHALL pass without using deprecated testing libraries

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper infrastructure and deployment configuration, so that the application can be deployed and scaled effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining Docker configuration THEN all applications SHALL have proper Dockerfile and docker-compose setup
2. WHEN using development containers THEN devcontainer configuration SHALL work properly
3. WHEN deploying to Kubernetes THEN infrastructure manifests SHALL be updated and functional
4. WHEN running database migrations THEN MongoDB setup and seeding SHALL work correctly

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation, so that I can understand and maintain the project effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading project documentation THEN README SHALL accurately reflect the current project structure
2. WHEN following setup instructions THEN all documentation SHALL be up-to-date and accurate
3. WHEN examining individual applications THEN each SHALL have proper documentation for setup and usage
4. WHEN reviewing architectural decisions THEN documentation SHALL explain the technology choices and patterns used
